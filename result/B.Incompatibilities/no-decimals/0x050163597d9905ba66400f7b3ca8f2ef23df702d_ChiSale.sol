/**
 * Chi Token Sale Contract with revenue sharing
 *
 * The intention of this contract is to run until the total value of 2000 ETH
 * is sold out. There is no time limit placed on the contract.
 *
 * The total number of CHI tokens allocated to the contract is equal to the
 * maximum number of tokens that can be acquired. This maximum number is
 * calculating the purchase of 2000 ETH of tokens, and adding the bonus tokens
 * for that purchase.
 *
 * The bonus tiers thresholds are calculated using the absolute number of sold
 * tokens (by this contract), and are as follows:
 *  - the 1st 150.000 tokens (0 - 149.999) get a bonus of 75%;
 *  - the 2nd 150.000 tokens (150.000 - 299.999) get a bonus of 60%;
 *  - the 3rd 150.000 tokens (300.000 - 449.999) get a bonus of 50%;
 *  - the 4th 150.000 tokens (450.000 - 599.999) get a bonus of 40%;
 *  - the 5th 150.000 tokens (600.000 - 749.999) get a bonus of 30%;
 *  - the 6th 150.000 tokens (750.000 - 899.999) get a bonus of 20%;
 *  - the next 300.000 tokens (900.000 - 1.199.999) get a bonus of 10%;
 *  - the next 300.000 tokens (1.200.000 - 1.499.999) get a bonus of 5%; and
 *  - the next 500.000 tokens (1.500.000 - 1.999.999) get a bonus of 2%.
 *
 * The maximum number of tokens this contract is able to hand out, can be
 * calculated using the following Python code:
 *  https://pyfiddle.io/fiddle/9bbc870a-534e-47b1-87c3-5f000bdd7d74/
