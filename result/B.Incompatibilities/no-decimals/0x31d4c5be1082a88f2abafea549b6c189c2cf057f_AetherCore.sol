    // them without disrupting the main contract that tracks property ownership.

    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major
    // facet of functionality of Aether. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still
    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:
    //
    //      - AetherBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core
    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus
    //             internal functions for managing these items.
    //
    //      - AetherAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations
    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.
    //
    //      - AetherOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token
    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).
    //
    //      - AetherAuction: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on property.
    //             The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts while auction
    //             creation and bidding is mostly mediated through this facet of the core contract.
    //
    //      - AetherConstruct: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats.
