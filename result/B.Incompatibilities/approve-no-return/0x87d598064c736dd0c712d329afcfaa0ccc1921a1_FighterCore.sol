    //      - FighterBattle: This file contains the methods necessary to allow a separate contract to handle battles
    //             allowing it to reward new prize fighters as well as update fighter stats.
    //
    //      - FighterAuction: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on fighters.
    //             The actual auction functionality is handled in a sibling sales contract,
    //             while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated through this facet of the core contract.
    //
    //      - FighterMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 fighters.
    //             We can make up to 5000 "promo" fighters that can be given away, and all others can only be created and then immediately put up
    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they
    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 25,000 gen0 fighters.
