   fixed price, uncapped token sale, with a discounted ratefor contributions
   ìn the private presale and a Market Validation Mechanism that will receive
   the funds over the USD 10M soft cap.
   The crowdsale has a minimum cap of USD 5M which in case of not being reached
   by purchases made during the 2 week period the token will not start operating
   and all funds sent during that period will be made available to be claimed by
   the originating addresses.
   Funds up to the USD 10M soft cap will be sent to the Winding Tree Foundation
   wallet at the end of the crowdsale.
   Funds over that amount will be put in a MarketValidationMechanism (MVM) smart
   contract that guarantees a price floor for a period of 2 or 4 years, allowing
   any token holder to burn their tokens in exchange of part of the eth amount
   sent during the TGE in exchange of those tokens.
