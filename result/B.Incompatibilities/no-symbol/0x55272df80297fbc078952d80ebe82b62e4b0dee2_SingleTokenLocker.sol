/*
 * A SingleTokenLocker allows a user to create a locker that can lock a single type of ERC20 token.
 * The token locker should:
 *    - Allow the owner to prove a certain number of their own tokens are locked for until a particular time
 *    - Allow the owner to transfer tokens to a recipient and prove the tokens are locked until a particular time
 *    - Allow the owner to cancel a transfer before a recipient confirms (in case of transfer to an incorrect address)
 *    - Allow the recipient to be certain that they will have access to transferred tokens once the lock expires
 *    - Be re-usable by the owner, so an owner can easily schedule/monitor multiple transfers/locks
 *
 * This class should be reusable for any ERC20 token.  Ideally, this sort of fine grained locking would be available in
 * the token contract itself.  Short of that, the token locker receives tokens (presumably from the locker owner) and
 * can be configured to release them only under certain conditions.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  - The owner creates a token locker for a particular ERC20 token type
 *  - The owner approves the locker up to some number of tokens: token.approve(tokenLockerAddress, tokenAmount)
 *    - Alternately, the owner can send tokens to the locker.  When locking tokens, the locker checks its balance first
 *  - The owner calls "lockup" with a particular recipient, amount, and unlock time.  The recipient will be allowed
 *    to collect the tokens once the lockup period is ended.
 *  - The recipient calls "confirm" which confirms that the recipient's address is correct and is controlled by the
 *    intended recipient (e.g. not an exchange address).  The assumption is that if the recipient can call "confirm"
 *    they have demonstrated that they will also be able to call "collect" when the tokens are ready.
 *  - Once the lock expires, the recipient calls "collect" and the tokens are transferred from the locker to the
 *    recipient.
 *
 * An owner can lockup his/her own tokens in order to demonstrate the they will not be moved until a particular time.
 * In this case, no separate "confirm" step is needed (confirm happens automatically)
 *
 * The following diagram shows the actual balance of the token locker and how it is tracked internally
 *
 *         +-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *         |                      Actual Locker Balance                  |
