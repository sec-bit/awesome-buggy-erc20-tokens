-------------------

ERC20 Token specification has made great contributions to the development of smart contracts, Ethereum ecosystem and blockchain applications since its birth on November 19th, 2015.

It has gone through many challenges and improvements during its growth, while numerous critical bugs were found in many ERC20 contracts and some of them even led to severe security incidents.

We made a collection of past bugs and vulnerabilities by issues in open-source projects with many transactions. This summary helps us learn issue details and get rid of them in future smart contract development. The index of bugged Token contracts is offered as well. It is intended for exchanges, DAPPs, developing teams and Token investors to find bugged Token contracts and avoid trade loss.



##  List of Vulnerabilities

Here is a detailed description of all bugs

- [Security Issues in ERC20 Smart Contracts](bug-list)



Here are lists of bugs with corresponding Token contracts

- [CSV format](csv)

- [JSON format](json)



## Collection of Affected Tokens

Here is a collection of all bugged contracts with the function of searching by the token contract's address. You could easily find information about the bug category, abbreviation and name of Token contracts.

- [JSON format](badtop600token.json)



## Epilogue

We hope to contribute to Ethereum ecosystem by this project.

We would maintain this list for a long period and make some updates from time to time. Cooperations are welcome to build a better Ethereum ecosystem together.
