Alfa-Tower - the investment project of a high-rise building with elite offices and luxury apartments.
The construction of the tower is in the center of Limassol on a plot of land 3600 m2.
The total cost of the investment is 12 million euros.
Since July 2017, the full development of the territory has been started. Geodesic miscalculations, measurements, and sysmic tests were carried out.
Received all the necessary licenses and permits for full-fledged construction. The package of attracted investments will be divided into 4 stages.
The first stage-July - December 2017 - 4 million euros, the second stage-January-March 2018-3 million euros, April-June 2018- 2 million euros, July-September 2018 - 3 million euros.
The completion of the construction is planned for October 2018. The advertising program for sales of offices and apartments has started. The average payback period of the project is 100-120% in 20 - 22 months. Such a large percentage of profit is due to several factors. 
1. Cyprus, a fast-growing and financially stable country, located in the European Union.
2. This investment project is located on the last vacant plot of land in the business center of Limassol, next to the central municipal court. 
3. The land is in the management of the company, thereby giving guarantees that the project is financially attractive.
4. The most respected company in the world, which participated in the construction of Jumeirah palms in Dubai, is engaged in the architectural and construction part.
5. The demand for class "A" office premises. 
6. This project is one of the first in Cyprus, which will have the status of an office-residential building.

The project consists of 8 ground floors, 3 underground floors, parking, an elite restaurant on the roof of the building, a fitness room, a beauty salon, 4 modern elevators, all offices have sea views, and the business part of the city.

At this stage, there are already applications for the purchase of office space for the restaurant, the office of plastic surgery, the crewing company, and several apartments.

At this stage, it is possible to purchase 80% of the total project, with 12 million euros costs. 
Accordingly, this equals 12 million shares.
